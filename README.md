    2. Analyze the Data
    3. Data Preprocessing.
    4. Building CNN Architecture
    5. Train the Model
    6. Model Evaluation on the Test Set
    7. Adding Dropout into the Network
    8. Final loss and accuracy
    
## Installation

To install the libraries used in this project. Follow the 
below steps:

```bash
%tensorflow_version 2.x
import tensorflow
tensorflow.__version__

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # plotting library
%matplotlib inline
from keras.models import Sequential
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam # - Works ,RMSprop
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical, plot_model
from keras import  backend as K
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.layers.convolutional import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D
# from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Activation, Flatten, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.layers import BatchNormalization
